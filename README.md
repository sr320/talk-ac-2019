Epigenetics has attracted considerable attention with respect to its potential value in many areas of agricultural production, particularly under conditions where the environment can be manipulated or natural variation exists. The function of DNA methylation in shellfish where the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in gene bodies is not completely understood. One emerging possible explanation is that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene function, a potential phenomenon that has arisen from selective pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. We know that in other taxa epigenetic marks are associated with phenotypes independent of genetic variation, the environment can influence DNA methylation, and epigenetic marks can be inherited. Specific case studies will be presented including looking at the role of DNA methylation in genomic regulatory function and heredity in oysters, and investigating the underpinnings of environmental memory in clams. These combined data suggest the application of epigenetic knowledge could significantly affect the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture practices.
